            <br><p>The Fate and Risk Evaluation System for Contaminants (FRESCO™) was developed for the Army with varying levels of capability to forecast the fate of and risk from contaminants and munitions constituents (MC), such as high explosives (HE) and metals, within and down-gradient from firing/training ranges to surface water and groundwater. The overall objective is to provide environmental specialists with tools to assess the potential for migration of MC into surface water and groundwater systems and to assess range management strategies to protect human and environmental health. FRESCO™ is robust enough to also be used to assess fate and risk of contaminants not associated with military activities.</p><br>
            <p>We have implemented serveral key improvements to enhance user experience and functionality. One of the most notable changes is the migration of the codebase from VB to C#, aligning with the latest .NET technologies and incorporating other modern libraries. We’ve also streamlined the code by removing unused files, which enhances overall efficiency. The soil models have been consolidated into a single, integrated code, simplifying maintenance and improving functionality. Additionally, the health benchmarks have been updated to reflect more accurate data, while the Arctic UI and algorithms have been enhanced for better performance and user experience. The Results Viewers have been improved to provide clearer insights, and a custom health benchmarks UI has been added for more tailored data presentation. Furthermore, the soil characterization process has been updated for greater precision, and we’ve incorporated a vastly improved Help system, now a single searchable resource that provides comprehensive documentation and support. These improvements demonstrate our commitment to continuous development and user satisfaction.</p>

            <h3 id="munitions">Munitions</h3>
            <p>The munition mass loading module calculates the residual munition constituent mass associated with each munition used on the range accounting for firing yield, and dud rates. Munitions are selected by munition type and Department of Defense identification code (DODIC) or National Stock Number (NSN). In Tier 2 the munition loading rate can vary in time.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 id="soil">Soil Source Zone</h3>
            <p>In the soil module the source zone solid (free product) and non-solid (dissolved) mass is initially determined by the Munition Residue Mass Loading Module and then tracked over time as the solid munition mass erodes, dissolves and leaches to the vadose zone, or is lost through runoff to surface water.
            </p>

            <h3 id="vadose">Vadose Zone</h3>
            <p>In the Vadose Zone Module the Multimedia  Environmental Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) is used to compute vertical fluxes of dissolved munition constituent from the soil layer to the aquifer.  A time varying flux can be computed in Tier 2.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 id="aquifer">Aquifer Zone</h3>
            <p>In the Aquifer Module the Multimedia  Environmental Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) is used to compute horizontal fluxes of dissolved munition constituent from the vadose zone to a target endpoint such as a well or surface water.  A time varying aquifer flux can be computed in Tier 2.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 id="surface water">Surface Water Zone</h3>
            <p>Two surface water models are available in FRESCO; the Contaminant Model for Streams (CMS) calculates concentrations at a downstream point in flowing water while the RECOVERY model is used for standing water such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands.  Time varying concentrations are determined in Tier 2 and multiple models can be applied to address combinations of surface water types affected by the range.
